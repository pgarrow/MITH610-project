         <p>They came from just about<lb/>
          everywhere. <placeName>New York</placeName>, <placeName>Phil-<lb break="no"/>­a­delphia</placeName>,
           <placeName>the District</placeName>, and some<lb/>
            from <placeName>Chicago</placeName>. They came by<lb/>
             bus, train, car and on foot.<lb/>
             They all came for the same<lb/>
              thing. They came because <persName>Adam</persName><lb/>
               was in trouble and therefore<lb/>
                they were in trouble too.</p>
         <p>Yesterday <persName><forename>Adam</forename> Clayton<lb/>
          <surname>Powell</surname></persName> had been stripped of his<lb/>
           committee chairmanship and to-<lb break="no"/>­­
           day he may be denied his seat<lb/>
            in <orgName>Congress</orgName>. They were there<lb/>
             to let people know that this was<lb/>
              not to their liking.</p>
         <p>The atmosphere on the <placeName>Capitol</placeName><lb/>
          steps was one of a mixed vapor<lb/>
           of injustice, impatience and im-<lb break="no"/>­­
           potence. Some of the collected<lb/>
             gathering wore buttons proclaim-<lb break="no"/>­­
             ing “<persName>Black Power</persName>," “Justice for<lb/>
               <persName><surname>Powell</surname></persName> and <placeName>Harlem</placeName>" and ‘Free­-<lb break="no"/>
               ­dom <sic>Now</sic>." A few of the crowd<lb/>
                 became orators, became hoarse<lb/>
                  and became silent. Most milled<lb/>
                   around in silence.</p>
         <p><persName><forename>Marion</forename> <surname>Barry</surname></persName>, head of the local<lb/>
          <orgName>SNCC</orgName> organization was there. He<lb/>
           was bearded and dapper in ap-<lb break="no"/>
           ­­pearance. He was also the chant-<lb break="no"/>­
            ­ maker as a dozen <persName>Negroes</persName> joined<lb/>
            hands to exhort “<persName>Black Power</persName>."<lb/>
             He led the transition to “Bring<lb/>
              the <persName>Black Troops</persName> Home" to “Po-<lb break="no"/>­
              ­litical intervention" to “Self-de-<lb break="no"/>­
              ­termination." This lasted only<lb/>
               a few minutes.</p>
         <p>A younger bearded sympathi-<lb break="no"/>­
         zer shouted that violence was<lb/>
          necessary. “The only way is<lb/>
           the <persName>Mau Mau</persName> way," he screamed.<lb/>
            “Let’s use <persName>Mau Mau</persName> tactics,"<lb/>
             he tried again. He was shat-<lb break="no"/>­
             ­tered by the cries of “Peace,<lb/>
              <persName>Brother</persName>" amidst the general si-<lb break="no"/>­
              ­lence.</p>
         <p>The <persName>"Queen Mother"</persName>, brightly<lb/>
          bedecked in robe and bandana,<lb/>
           began a 30 minute spiel covering<lb/>
            the Bible, the history of the <persName>Negro</persName><lb/>
             in American politics and the his-<lb break="no"/>­
             ­tory that was being made that<lb/>
              day. She was encouraged by<lb/>
               shouts of “you right, <persName>Mother</persName>"<lb/>
                and "tell it like it is, <persName>mom</persName>.<sic>[sic: missing quote mark in original]</sic><lb/>
                 She was rewarded for her ef­-<lb break="no"/>­
                 forts by a five dollar bill passed<lb/>
                  to her from a man in a heavy<lb/>
                   raccoon coat.</p>
        <p>A light-skinned man followed<lb/>
          her as the impromtu speaker of<lb/>
           the moment. He described the<lb/>
            three fronts that confront the<lb/>
            <cb n="2"/>
             people of the country. The first<lb/>
              was <placeName>Vietnam</placeName>. The second was<lb/>
               the approaching shooting-war be-<lb break="no"/>­
               ­ tween <placeName>Jordan</placeName> and <placeName>Israel</placeName>. This<lb/>
                signaled the third front he said<lb/>
                 because the Jews were taking<lb/>
                  over the country. “Those white<lb/>
                   policemen down there,* he point-<lb break="no"/>­
                   ­ed, “and these white reporters<lb/>
                    here are <persName>slaves</persName> too. ‘The Jew<lb/>
                     runs this <orgName>Congress</orgName>, this town and<lb/>
                      this country," he continued.</p>
         <p>The crowd on the steps of the<lb/>
          House wing of the <placeName>Capitol</placeName>, pre­-<lb break="no"/>­
          dominantly <persName>Negro</persName>, often over­-<lb break="no"/>­
          flowed into the street. They<lb/>
           were herded back by blue-coated<lb/>
            policemen who were everywhere.<lb/>
             Across the street, curious on­-<lb break="no"/>­
             lookers paused to watch the pro-<lb break="no"/>­
             ­ceedings. Over there the crowd<lb/>
              was mostly white and amused.</p>
         <p>Someone burned a draft card<lb/>
          and was cheered for his action.<lb/>
           Someone else copied this <sic>firey</sic><lb/>
            demonstration and soon another<lb/>
             and another. The chant of “Burn<lb/>
              Baby, Burn" began to echo across<lb/>
               the street and into the park.</p>
         <p>The crowd waited. <persName><forename>Adam</forename></persName> was<lb/>
          scheduled to appear at 1:45 p.m.<lb/>
           and there was nothing to do but<lb/>
            wait. Another orator appeared.<lb/>
             He was tired of “hanging on."<lb/>
              “My mother told me to hang<lb/>
               on," he said. “Everybody tells<lb/>
                me to hang on. I don’t want to<lb/>
                 hang on anymore. I want to be<lb/>
                  free and I want unity." The word<lb/>
                   caught the tongues of the crowd.<lb/>
                    “Unity! Unity!”, rippled through<lb/>
                     the charged air.</p>
         <p>Someone sat down. Several<lb/>
          more followed suit. Angry voices<lb/>
           urged them back onto their feet.<lb/>
            “We been sitting down long<lb/>
             enough. Get up, <persName>Brothers</persName> and<lb/>
              <persName>sisters</persName>. We are going to wait<lb/>
               for the man and then we move.<sic>[sic: missing quotate mark in original]</sic></p>
         <p>“Which way?," someone asked.<lb/>
          “That way !" was the answer as<lb/>
           a manpointed<sic>[sic: missing space in original]</sic> to the door of the<lb/>
            <orgName>House</orgName> which was blocked by a<lb/>
             solid wall of blue-coats. The<lb/>
              ranks cheered and then resumed<lb/>
               waiting.</p>
         <p><persName><surname>Powell</surname></persName> was 20 minutes over-<lb break="no"/>­
         ­ due to appear. The crowd grew<lb/>
          more restless. There was a<lb/>
           flurry of movement in the tun­-<lb break="no"/>­
           nel under the steps. The mass<lb/>
            of humans surged in that di­-<lb break="no"/>­
            rection. Photographers fought<lb/>
             for position among the pushing<lb/>
              bodies. Stationary cameras<lb/>
               focused on empty space and their<lb/>
                cameramen cursed this misfor­-<lb break="no"/>­
                tune.</p>
         <p>It was not <persName><forename>Adam</forename></persName>. A spokes-<lb break="no"/>­
         ­ man repeated to the crowd what<lb/>
          he had heard. <persName><surname>Powell</surname></persName> had left<lb/>
           but would return in five minutes.<lb/>
            The crowd was stunned and then<lb/>
             recovered. “What was the vote?",<sic>[sic: comma outside quote mark in original]</sic>
                   <cb n="3"/>
              someone shouted and others<lb/>
               echoed. There was still no word<lb/>
                on the balloting of the <orgName>Repre-<lb break="no"/>­
                ­sentatives</orgName> concerning <persName><surname>Powell</surname></persName>’s<lb/>
                 seating. The group slowly moved<lb/>
                  back on the steps. The abandoned<lb/>
                   cameraman heaved, a sigh of<lb/>
                    relief.</p>
         <p><persName><surname>Powell</surname></persName> had not been seated they<lb/>
          knew. Angry voices rose above<lb/>
           the muttering. “They see the<lb/>
            handwriting on the wall. That's<lb/>
             why they stripped him of his<lb/>
              power. They ain’t seen a revo-<lb break="no"/>­
              ­lution yet." A well-dressed man<lb/>
               spoke to his companion, “I<lb/>
                been around. I been in a war<lb/>
                 and I have never seen it like<lb/>
                  this."</p>
         <p>There was another flurry of<lb/>
          activity under the steps and the<lb/>
           crowd moved. A man was ar-<lb break="no"/>­
           ­rested and the people appeared<lb/>
            ready to vent their anger and<lb/>
             frustration. A large group of<lb/>
              the more militant swarmed<lb/>
               across the street. Photogra-<lb break="no"/>­
               ­phers followed but kept a safe<lb/>
                distance. It was an uneasy<lb/>
                 moment.</p>
         <p>Then the man appeared. He<lb/>
          emerged from his car and be-<lb break="no"/>­
          ­gan walking the last 75 yards<lb/>
           to the steps. He was instant­-<lb break="no"/>­
           ly inundated by his flock. They<lb/>
            screamed his name and clawed<lb/>
             their way toward him.</p>
         <p><persName><surname>Powell</surname></persName> stopped to speak at<lb/>
         the bottom of the steps but the<lb/>
          crowd was too great, too ex-<lb break="no"/>­
          ­cited. They thrust him up, up<lb/>
           until all could see. In the crush<lb/>
            cameras were knocked over but<lb/>
             the crowd surged on. Finally<lb/>
              he was able to turn and he<lb/>
               spoke.</p>
         <p>They listened attentively. He<lb/>
          could say no wrong. He said<lb/>
           they no longer had a representa-<lb break="no"/>­
           ­tive in <orgName>Congress</orgName>. “You are our<lb/>
            representative, <persName><forename>Adam</forename></persName>," the<lb/>
             voices in unison disagree. “<persName><forename>Adam</forename></persName><lb/>
              for President," they chorused to<lb/>
               the idea of a third party.</p>
         <p>Soon it was over and <persName><surname>Powell</surname></persName><lb/>
          struggled toward his car. The<lb/>
           crowd was everywhere. Once<lb/>
            <persName><surname>Powell</surname></persName> was inside they refused<lb/>
             to leave his side. They tried<lb/>
              to touch him through the glass<lb/>
               and metal. The sleek limousine<lb/>
                moved off slowly and they hung<lb/>
                 on for blocks.</p>
         <p>Back on the steps the cameras<lb/>
          were dismantled and put away.<lb/>
           Down on the street weary <sic>police-<lb break="no"/>­
           ­ man</sic> made their way toward the<lb/>
            station. Across the street, the<lb/>
             curious were satisfied with what<lb/>
              they had seen and departed.<lb/>
               <persName><forename>Adam</forename></persName>'s army had not won the<lb/>
                <sic>war-</sic> had not even won the bat-<lb break="no"/>­
                ­tle - but they had been there.</p></div>
