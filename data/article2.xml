         <p><placeName>NEW YORK</placeName><orgName ref="A-P">(AP)</orgName>--Congressman-elect <persName><forename>Adam</forename> <forename>Clayton</forename> <surname>Pow­-<lb break="no"/>­­
          ell</surname></persName> hailed as “monumental" yesterday a <orgName>U.S. Supreme Court</orgName><lb/>
           decision to hear his suit against the House of Representa­-<lb break="no"/>
            tives’ decision to exclude him in 1967.</p>
         <p> Proclaiming himself “extremely gratified," <persName><surname>Powell</surname></persName> told<lb/>
           a news conference the decision showed “we are now living<lb/>
            again in a republic with three branches of government."</p>
         <p> The flamboyant <orgName>Democrat</orgName>, who had 22 years’ seniority<lb/>
           at the time of his exclusion from <orgName>Congress</orgName>, was re-elected<lb/>
            by an overwhelming majority the same year and again in the<lb/>
             general election <date when="1968-11-05"></date> Nov. 5.</p>
          <p><persName><surname>Powell</surname></persName> <sic> [sic: missing possessive in original]</sic> suit alleged that the <orgName>House of Representatives</orgName> acted<lb/>
           unconstitutionally in excluding him.  When asked whether he<lb/>
            was optimistic about the <orgName>Supreme Court</orgName>’s decision in the<lb/>
             case, he said, “I’ve always been optimistic."</p>
          <p>While stepping into the <persName><surname>Powell</surname></persName> case, the <orgName>court<sic> [sic: missing capitalization]</sic></orgName> also upheld<lb/>
           Arkansas’ “full-crew” railroad laws and took on three major<lb/>
            appeals.</p>
          <p>Arkansas laws, upheld by a 7-1 voted<sic> [sic: unnecessary letter "d" in original]</sic>, require railroads<lb/>
           to put more crewmen on trains than the railroads say are<lb/>
            necessary. In October 1967 a federal court in Hot Springs<lb/>
             threw the laws out, saying they put an illegal burden on<lb/>
              railroads that operated through Arkansas.</p>
          <p>From Delaware comes the Miranda case where Thornton
           A. Jenkins was first sentenced to death for Wilmington murder<lb/>
            and later, on retrial, to life in prison.</p>
          <p>Jenkins was first tried in <date when="1966-01">January 1966</date>, five months before<lb/>
           the Supreme Court required police, under what has become<lb/>
            known as the Miranda rule, to advise suspects they don’t<lb/>
             have to answer any questions and that they are entitled to a lawyer.</p>
          <p>Ohio’s syndicalism law makes it a crime to advocate vio-<lb break="no"/>
           ­lence or terror to accomplish political change. A convicted<lb/>
          Cincinnati man, Clarence Brandenberg, claims the law il­-<lb break="no"/>
           legally regulates speech.</p></div>
