         <p><placeName>NEW YORK</placeName><orgName ref="#AP">(AP)</orgName>--Congressman-elect <persName><forename>Adam</forename> Clayton Pow­-<lb break="no"/>­­
         ell<surname>Powell</surname></persName> hailed as “monumental" yesterday a <orgName>U.S. Supreme Court</orgName><lb/>
          decision to hear his suit against the House of Representa­-<lb break="no"/>
          tives’ decision to exclude him in 1967.</p>
         <p> Proclaiming himself “extremely gratified," <persName><surname>Powell</surname></persName> told<lb/>
          a news conference the decision showed “we are now living<lb/>
          again in a republic with three branches of government."</p>
         <p> The flamboyant <orgName>Democrat</orgName>, who had 22 years’ seniority<lb/>
          at the time of his exclusion from <orgName>Congress</orgName>, was re-elected<lb/>
          by an overwhelming majority the same year and again in the<lb/>
          general election <date when="Nov.5">November 5, 1968</date> Nov. 5.</p>
          Powell<sic>missing possessive</sic> suit alleged that the House of Representatives acted<lb/>
          unconstitutionally in excluding him.  When asked whether he<lb/>
          was optimistic about the <orgName>Supreme Court</orgName>’s decision in the<lb/>
          case, he said, “I’ve always been optimistic."</p>
          While stepping into the <persName><surname>Powell</surname></persName> case, the <orgName>court<sic>missing capitalization</sic></orgName> also upheld<lb/>
          <placeName>Arkansas</placeName>’ “full-crew” railroad laws and took on three major<lb/>
          appeals.</p>
          <placeName>Arkansas</placeName> laws, upheld by a 7-1 voted<sic>unnecessary letter "d"</sic>, require railroads<lb/>
          to put more crewmen on trains than the railroads say are<lb/>
          necessary. In October 1967 a federal court in Hot Springs<lb/>
          threw the laws out, saying they put an illegal burden on<lb/>
          railroads that operated through <placeName>Arkansas</placeName>.
          From <placeName>Delaware</placeName> comes the Miranda case where <persName><forename>Thornton</foreName><lb/>
          A. <surname>Jenkins</surname></persName> was first sentenced to death for Wilmington murder<lb/>
          and later, on retrial, to life in prison.</p>
          <persName><surname>Jenkins</surname></persName> was first tried in <date when="January 1966">January 1966</date>, five months before<lb/>
          the <orgName>Supreme Court</orgName> required police, under what has become<lb/>
          known as the Miranda rule, to advise suspects they don’t<lb/>
          have to answer any questions and that they are entitled to a lawyer.</p>
          <placeName>Ohio</placeName>’s syndicalism law makes it a crime to advocate vio-<lb break="no"/>
          ­lence or terror to accomplish political change. A convicted<lb/>
          <placeName>Cincinnati</placeName> man, <persName><forename>Clarence</foreName> <surname>Brandenberg</surname></persName>, claims the law il­-<lb break="no"/>
          legally regulates speech.</p></div>
