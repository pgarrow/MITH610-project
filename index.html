    <h1>Powell and Politics: The Rise of African American Political Consciousness in Harlem and Beyond</h1>
    <div id="description"><p>As we ponder methods to increase interest, acceptance, and visibility of black digital humanities, it is intriguing to ponder possible assumptions and associations that readers may bring to the field. In order to see how past perspectives have helped shape the present, it is enlightening to review contemporary news articles such as those that appeared in the University of Maryland’s The Diamondback student newspaper during the late 1960s. It was a volatile period for race relations in a variety of fields, one of which – national politics – was arguably among the most visible. The two articles that follow provide insight into a racially-charged political and legal scandal which sparked an unusually high amount of reaction and indignation among the African American community.</p>
 <p>In 1945, Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. became the first black American elected to represent the Harlem district in the United States House of Representatives (Editors).  By advancing in seniority through a series of successive re-election bids, he was appointed chairman of the Education and Labor Committee fifteen years later, despite ruffling feathers with an eccentric personal style and willingness to publicly address race relations (Editors). After being accused of improperly handling his committee’s discretionary funds for his personal benefit, the House voted to remove him from both his chairmanship and his seat; that action ignited widespread opposition among his constituents and the African American community at large. In the first Diamondback article from 1967, supporters hold a public rally to encourage the House to allow Powell to serve. Despite the presence of reporters from a variety of media who help publicize their efforts, they were not successful. Powell litigated, and over a year later, the Diamond back recounts that the Supreme Court agreed to hear his case. Subsequent research revealed that although the Court ruled in his favor for Powell vs. McCormack in 1969, he lost his re-election bid in 1970 to Charles R. Rangel; Rangel held the position until 2017 (Hicks).</p>
<p>An interesting assumption on the part of the authors of both articles (Ted Linzey in the former and the Associated Press in the later) is that the audience was well-familiar with the outlines of the case. Powell’s status as a historic ground-breaker is never addressed, nor is it explicitly explained why the African American community is so united in their support for him. The 1967 article employs the antiquated term “Negro” to describe black Americans; intriguingly, the case update in 1968 makes no mention of race at all.<p>
<p> In the two articles which follow, personal names of African American political figures and activists appear in red in order to draw the reader's attention. Place names and organization titles appear in green and blue, respectively; these are only highlighted to give the reader a better sense of the wide scope of the movement. Note that colors are not applied to people, places, or groups when they are mentioned in contexts other than black political activism (such as the other Supreme Court case summaries provided in article 2. In the interest of accuracy, the column, paragraph, and line structure of the original articles are reproduced. Further, all original errors are retained but are identified via [sic] as well as explicit amplifying information; sometimes I identify simple style errors and other cases involve inappropriate word choice by the original author. Thus, it seemed best to provide additional clarification vice employing [sic] in the usual manner.
